# 3D_hand_model_guided_by_camera
Personal project: The idea was born as a challenge to take the multiple skills I have, unify them, and try to give them a use. The plan is first to work with object recognition models, then use that to work in an environment with 3D objects, and then sync the model's movements with a model made in Arduino.
